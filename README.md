# rock-paper-scissors

<p> This project is my first ever JavaScript project. The aim was to get comfortable with the basic syntax of the language, so I decided to do my own implementation of the well-known game: rock, paper, scissors.
<p> For now it can only be played on the browser console, but I plan on implementing a graphical user interface with buttons and text in the Future. </p>
