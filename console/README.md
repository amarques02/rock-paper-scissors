# rock-paper-scissors

<p> This project is my first ever JavaScript project. The aim was to get comfortable with the basic syntax of the language, so I decided to do my own implementation of the well-known game: rock, paper, scissors.
<p> This was my first version, so it can only be played on the browser console.</p>
